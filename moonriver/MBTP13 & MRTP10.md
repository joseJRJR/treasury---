# [MB13/MR10] OnFinality High Performance Public Infrastructure (2023, Q2)]
**Abstract**  - Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for the Moonbeam, Moonbase Alpha and Moonriver networks from 1st April 2023 until 30th June 2023 (3 months).

**Motivation**  - Setting up blockchain infrastructure is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. A shared node API service helps mitigate these barriers of entry to trying accessing a new protocol by reducing all these costs to near zero. In summary, we try to reduce the pain of getting started on the Moonbeam Networks and minimise the costs of accessing secure nodes while traffic from your dApp is low.

**Project Overview and Team Experience**  -  [OnFinality  1](https://onfinality.io/)  is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community. Our mission is to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.

**Overall Cost**  - We’ve created two proposals to cover the combined running costs for our infrastructure - one for Moonriver network and one for both Moonbeam and Moonbase Alpha Networks. The total outstanding costs for these networks are 3,081.3435 MOVR (USD$17,145.17) and 100,215.4235 GLMR (USD$25,543.41) respectively.

**Use of Treasury Funds**  - All funds will be used to pay for resources and infrastructure used to provide the service during January, February, March (Q1) of 2023.

**Specifications**  - We have a heavily modified multi-cloud and multi-region landscape that maximizes performance, reliability, scalability, and decentralisation. Additionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the ecosystem in the last quarter.

-   [Launched Trace API  1](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-trace-api-for-unprecedented-visibility-into-your-dapps/)  allowing unprecedented visibility for dApp builders. Trace API captures and records vital information otherwise not available through regular RPC methods and extrinsics (such as complete XCM transfer records and complete list of balance changes). These APIs are essential in order for  [developers like Polkaholic](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinalitys-new-trace-api-helping-colorful-notion-get-trace-data-from-over-40-substrate-chains/)  to parse and understand XCM transactions.
-   [Geographical Insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/)  - API key owners can view statistics about where in the world your community are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives
-   [Clarify our IP address handling](https://blog.onfinality.io/how-does-onfinality-deal-with-personal-information/)  - OnFinality does not, and will never, correlate or link specific wallet addresses to the IP address or request origin making the RPC request
-   Added support for a number of new networks, including Anmol, HydraDX, Equilibrium, as well as Osmosis, Evmos, Harmony, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fuse, DFK Chain, Celo, and Klaytn from outside the ecosystem. OnFinality is a new one stop shop for all of your RPC needs from multiple ecosystems.
-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.
-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any substrate team

**Steps to Implement**  - This service has already been provided and we are proud to have achieved 100%, 99.59% and 100% uptime for Moonriver, Moonbeam and Moonbase Alpha respectively ([https://status.onfinality.io/](https://status.onfinality.io/) ).
